A set of PHP snippets to avoid bullshitty php code. Grab any code you like.

`I dislike PHP`_. But I have some legacy code I have to deal with. Therefore I wrote some snippets I can easily copy and paste to my source code and make PHP better. The ``unfuck.php`` file focuses on the following things:

* Enforce basic Unicode support
* Provide missing stdlib functions and classes
* Dealing with php's buggy type system

Requirements
------------

* Requires PHP â‰¥ 4 on a webserver

Installation
------------

* Install the user.ini according to the `PHP Manual`_.
* Copy&Paste or ``include`` source code of ``unfuck.php``.
* Watch out for ``@config`` directives in ``unfuck.php`` where you have to adjust configuration variables to your own needs.

Please stop using PHP. Every time you write php code little kittens die.
